      <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>

      <p>
        My name is Elise, and I am a Gaffer with a strong foundation in both production
        and visual storytelling. As a filmmaker, I focus on character-driven narratives,
        thoughtful composition, and innovative production workflows. I use light and
        color deliberately to shape emotional tension and guide the audience’s
        psychological experience.
      </p>

      <p>
        With a background in production, I have worked extensively with psychological
        horror and theatrically inspired experimental films. I approach each project
        with structure and clarity, ensuring that creative vision and practical execution
        remain aligned throughout the process. I value transparent communication,
        responsible budgeting, and steady leadership at every stage of production.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you’re looking for someone who approaches film with both precision and
        atmosphere, let’s create something meaningful together.
