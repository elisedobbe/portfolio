      <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Elise, and I am a Gaffer with a strong foundation in both production and visual
        storytelling. As a filmmaker, I focus on character-driven narratives, thoughtful composition,
        and innovative production workflows. I use light and color deliberately to shape emotional
        tension and guide the audience’s psychological experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a background in production, I have worked extensively with psychological horror and
        theatrically inspired experimental films. I approach each project with structure and clarity,
        ensuring that creative vision and practical execution remain aligned throughout the process.
        I value transparent communication, responsible budgeting, and steady leadership at every stage
        of production.
      </p>

        If you’re looking for someone who approachs film with both precision and atmosphere, let’s
        create something meaningful together.
